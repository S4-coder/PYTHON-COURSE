# Introduction to Python Programming

# Variables and their real-world usage:
# 1. User Information in Apps
name = "Python Learner"    # Storing user's name in a social media app
age = 25                   # Storing user's age in a registration form
is_student = True         # Tracking if user is a student for discounts

# 2. E-commerce Examples
product_price = 999.99    # Price of a product
stock_quantity = 50       # Number of items in inventory
is_in_stock = True       # Product availability status

# 3. Game Development
player_score = 0          # Tracking player's score
player_health = 100       # Player's health in a game
game_active = True       # Game state tracking

# Basic input/output in real applications:
# 1. User Registration System
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")  # Getting user details in a form
print("Welcome,", user_input)

# 2. Basic Calculator Operations
x = 10
y = 5
# Used in:
# - Financial calculations (bank interest)
# - Scientific calculations (physics formulas)
# - Score calculations in games
print("Addition:", x + y)      # Total amount calculation
print("Subtraction:", x - y)   # Remaining balance calculation
print("Multiplication:", x * y) # Area calculation
print("Division:", x / y)       # Rate per unit calculation
